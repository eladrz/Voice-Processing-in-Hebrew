# Voice-Processing-in-Hebrew

receives a Hebrew sentence from the user and sends it to the Raspberry Pi 4, which works as a server using the TCP protocol.
The Raspberry Pi can be programmed to determine what action to take based on the received command(for example: the command Red is turn on Red led).
The system is completely portable, and it does not require internet access, only a local WiFi connection.
The code is written in Python.
